## Inspiration
We were inspired to create a tool that enhances cognitive skills and makes learning engaging. With the growing need for interactive and educational tools, we wanted to design an app that combines fun with brain training exercises to help users improve memory, problem-solving, and focus.

## What it does
Brain Boost offers a variety of brain-training games and activities such as puzzles, memory challenges, and logic exercises. Users can track their progress, challenge themselves with increasing difficulty, and develop better mental agility over time.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the core of the application. For styling, we used Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS to make it responsive and user-friendly. We also explored Math.js for handling logical and calculation-based challenges. Git and GitHub were used for version control and collaboration.

## Challenges we ran into
- Designing puzzles that are challenging yet enjoyable for different age groups  
- Ensuring smooth performance and responsiveness across devices  
- Tracking scores and progress dynamically without affecting usability  

---

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Built an interactive and fun platform that users can learn from  
- Created adaptive difficulty levels to keep players engaged  
- Designed a clean, visually appealing interface

## What we learned
- Balancing challenge and usability is key in educational games  
- Techniques for creating interactive web features and handling user input effectively  
- How to collaborate efficiently as a team and integrate components seamlessly

## What's next for Brain Boost
- Add more types of games and challenges  
- Introduce user accounts with personalized progress tracking  
- Expand into mobile app development for wider accessibility

## Technologies Used
Brain Boost was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with optional Python for backend logic. We used frameworks and libraries like React.js or vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling, and Math.js for logic and math-based challenges. The platform is web-based and responsive for both desktop and mobile. We considered GitHub Pages for hosting and Firebase for authentication or storing user progress. External APIs can also be integrated for dynamic content. Git and GitHub were used for version control and collaboration.
